### Canada Computers Tools Issue Tracker

## Purpose

The purpose of the Tools Issue Tracker is to serve as a centralized place for me to monitor all tool-related issues. It ensures that duplicate issues are not added and provides clear visibility into which issues have been resolved and which ones are still in progress.

## How to Use

# 1. Adding a New Issue
- Before creating a new entry, check the tracker to confirm the issue has not already been reported.
- If it is new, add the issue with a short description, the date reported, and any relevant details.

# 2. Updating an Issue
- When progress is made, update the status (e.g., In Progress, Pending Parts, Resolved).
- Include notes if needed to clarify what has been done.

# 3. Closing an Issue
- Once the issue is fully resolved, mark it as Resolved and include the resolution date.

# 4. Reviewing Issues
- Use the tracker regularly to see what issues remain open and avoid duplicate reporting.
